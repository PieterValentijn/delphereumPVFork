## What is Delphereum?

Delphereum is a Delphi interface to the Ethereum blockchain that allows for development of native dApps (aka _decentralised apps_).

## What is Delphi?

Delphi is a development environment that compiles into native apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contracts.

## What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. You can think of a smart contract as a microservice that runs on the backend of your application.

## What is a dApp?

A dApp is an application whose backend runs on a decentralised network with trustless protocols. dApps arenâ€™t owned by anyone, cannot be shut down, and have zero downtime.
