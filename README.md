## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contracts.

## What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. You can think of a smart contract as a microservice that runs on the backend of your application.

## What is a dApp?

A dApp is an application whose backend runs on a decentralised network with trustless protocols. dApps arenâ€™t owned by anyone, cannot be shut down, and have zero downtime.
